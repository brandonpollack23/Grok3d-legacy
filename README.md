# Grok3d - An Open Source Game Engine You can Grok!

This is an attempt to make an ecs from scratch using only c++

I later intend to (we'll see fef) port this to rust, but I wanted to learn opengl/dx with c++ so how i know how it SHOULD work first

## Goals

The main goal is to be well documented and grokable.

I want to write a book to accompany this engine that, if read along with the code's documentation and source (with an appendix that explains each source file
and how it fits into the architechture) you can go from beginning c++ programmer to..well at least understanding this engine, hopefully solid intermediate c++.


## Contributing

not until it is a stable, real, functioning engine that does something...anything
